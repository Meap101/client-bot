# client-bot

A lot of friends were asking me for this old code, so I decided I'd just upload it for the World Wide Webâ„¢ to see.
Useful for, I don't know, disguising the fact that you're using discord? i don't really see the appeal or demand

## setup and usage

Pretty straightforward, just `cd` into the directory, run `npm install` (requires node), and edit config.json appropriately to include your bot's token and the ID of the channel you'd like to chat in

to run the bot, just input `node index.js`

type directly into the console to send messages. messages from other people will also show up on screen
i left a couple of extras in there as well, `shruggie` and `tableflip` both send their respective emoticons. nothing big, you could easily add more shortcuts on your own if you'd like
